                    <h4>ALL ABOUT ME IN 5 THINGS</h4>

                        <li><h4>Feel</h4>
                            <p>After over 25 years of overthinking about almost everything in my life, I got tired and decided to change the way my instinct works from thinking to feeling. From those moments, feelings and emotions have become key components of all my activities. My life is much easier even though those feelings and emotions can go wrong sometimes and affect my stuff a bit, but thanks to it, I have had a chance to learn to control my emotions better.

                            <p>To me, life is very simple but day by day, it seems that people are making it more complicated with their thoughts and actions. And with the advancement of the Internet, it is getting worse and worse because many people are looking at the complicated actions of others and getting carried away to not notice the simpler things.
